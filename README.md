## backstory
Beautidocs was a project that I worked on a couple of years ago. Now my coding skills are a lot better, however the original idea of making a documentation, with simply 4 files, sparked me to go back and do the project again. This is **not** a fork of the project, rather a version that is higher quality.

Yes, it might not be as customizable, however the simplicity of having 4 files, including a settings, markdown and styling, was begging me to come back to this.

## changes
The original documentation was built inside of SvelteKit, however I don't use SvelteKit much anymore, so I'm moving over to Next.js, which will ultimately change the quality of the project. For the UI library, I was using Material UI, a port for Svelte. This time, I'm using shadcn/ui. I think personally it looks alot better than before, which is why ultimately I'm going to move over to shadcn/ui.
